    "Basil is a warm-season crop and can be directly sown in the garden when the soil has warmed up to at least 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C). Pinch off flower buds as they form to encourage leaf growth.",
    "Lettuce prefers cooler temperatures, so plant it in early spring or late summer/early fall. Choose a variety that is resistant to bolting and provide partial shade during the hottest part of the day.",
    "Soil preparation is key in Beverly Hills' clay-rich soil. Add organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve drainage and fertility.",
    "Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth, which will help your plants survive droughts and heatwaves.",
    "Keep an eye out for pests like hornworms, aphids, and whiteflies, and use natural methods of control whenever possible."
