    "Beets prefer well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0, so test your soil before planting.",
    "In Moncton's cold climate, start Bok Choy seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date to give them a head start on the growing season.",
    "Beets are a cool-season crop and can tolerate light frosts, but they'll bolt (go to seed) if it gets too warm. Plant them in early spring or late summer for best results.",
    "Bok Choy prefers full sun to partial shade, so choose a location that receives at least 4 hours of direct sunlight per day.",
    "Moncton's growing season is relatively short, so make sure to plant Beets and Bok Choy as soon as the soil can be worked in spring, typically around late April or early May.",
    "Beets are susceptible to root maggots, which can be controlled with row covers or insecticidal soap. Keep an eye out for these pests when growing Beets in Moncton."
