    "Choose varieties of tomato and kale that are specifically bred for cooler climates and shorter growing seasons, such as 'Brandywine' or 'Red Russian'.",
    "In Moncton's cold climate, it's essential to provide protection from extreme temperatures. Use row covers or cold frames to extend the growing season.",
    "Purple kale is a cool-season crop and prefers the cooler temperatures of spring or fall. Plant in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked, or in late summer for a fall harvest.",
    "Tomatoes need full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) and well-draining soil to thrive. Make sure your garden bed has good drainage and consider adding organic matter like compost to improve soil fertility.",
    "In Moncton's short growing season, it's crucial to make the most of every day. Use a trellis or cage to support indeterminate tomato plants and keep them upright, promoting healthy growth and fruiting.",
    "Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails that can damage your crops in Moncton's humid climate. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible."
