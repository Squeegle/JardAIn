    "Soil preparation is key: add compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and drainage, as Moncton's clay soils can be heavy and waterlogged.",
    "Broccoli prefers cooler temperatures (around 60\u00b0F/15\u00b0C), so plant it in early spring or late summer for a fall harvest. Spinach is more tolerant of heat but still prefers cooler conditions.",
    "Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth, reducing the risk of overwatering and related diseases.",
    "Watch out for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails that thrive in Moncton's humid climate; use organic controls whenever possible."
