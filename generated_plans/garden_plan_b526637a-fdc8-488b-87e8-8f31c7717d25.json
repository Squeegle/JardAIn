    "Choose a location with full sun to partial shade for your purple kale plants, as they require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.",
    "In Moncton's cold climate, it's essential to start purple kale seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date (around late May). Sow seeds in seed trays or small pots and keep them in a warm location until they're ready to be transplanted outside.",
    "Purple kale prefers well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Test your soil to determine its pH level and amend it if necessary. Add compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and drainage.",
    "Water your purple kale plants regularly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot and other problems. Aim for about 1 inch of water per week, either from rain or irrigation.",
    "Purple kale is a cool-season crop and does best in temperatures between 40\u00b0F and 70\u00b0F (4\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C). In Moncton's climate, it's best to plant purple kale in early spring or late summer/early fall for a fall harvest.",
    "Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails, which can damage your purple kale plants. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible, such as neem oil or diatomaceous earth."
