    "Beverly Hills has a Mediterranean climate with warm summers and mild winters. Choose varieties of plants that thrive in these conditions.",
    "Soil preparation is key: Beverly Hills' soil tends to be alkaline, so add organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve drainage and fertility.",
    "Water wisely: Tomatoes and peppers need about 1 inch of water per week, while lettuce and herbs prefer moist but not soggy conditions. Check the soil daily and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.",
    "Tomato plants can grow quite large in Beverly Hills' warm climate. Provide support with tomato cages or trellises to keep them upright and encourage fruiting.",
    "Basil is a warm-season crop that loves the sun. Plant it after the last frost date (usually around February 15th) for optimal growth.",
    "Carrots, lettuce, and radishes prefer cooler temperatures and can be planted in early spring or late summer/early fall to avoid heat stress.",
    "Spinach and parsley are cool-season crops that thrive in Beverly Hills' mild winters. Plant them from September to November or February to April for a bountiful harvest.",
    "Zucchini is a warm-season crop that loves the sun and can be planted after the last frost date. Provide plenty of space between plants (about 3-4 feet) to prevent overcrowding and promote healthy growth."
