    "Green onions can be grown in containers or directly in the ground, but make sure they have at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.",
    "In Moncton's cool climate, it's essential to provide support for tall plants like kale and lettuce using stakes or a trellis.",
    "Beets and green onions are ready to harvest when the roots are between 1-2 inches in diameter, while lettuce is ready when the leaves are 4-6 inches long.",
    "To extend the growing season, consider using row covers or cold frames to protect plants from frost and freezing temperatures."
