    "Radishes are quick-growing and can be harvested in as little as 20 days. Make sure to sow seeds every 1-2 weeks for continuous harvests.",
    "Green beans prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Test your soil before planting to ensure it's suitable for green beans.",
    "In Moncton's short growing season, use row covers or cold frames to extend the growing season for both radishes and green beans.",
    "Radishes are sensitive to heat and can bolt (go to seed) if the temperature rises above 75\u00b0F. Keep them shaded during hot weather.",
    "For a successful green bean harvest, provide support with trellises or cages as they grow, and keep the area around the plants weed-free."
