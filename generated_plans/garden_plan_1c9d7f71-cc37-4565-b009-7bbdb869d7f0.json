    "Start seedlings indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date to give them a head start on the growing season.",
    "Beets prefer cooler temperatures, so plant them as soon as the soil can be worked in spring, about 2-3 weeks after the last frost.",
    "Peppers are warm-season crops and thrive in Moncton's long growing season. Plant them outside when the soil has warmed up to at least 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).",
    "In Moncton's cool climate, it's essential to provide support for pepper plants as they grow. Use tomato cages or trellises to keep them upright and promote fruiting.",
    "Beets are a hardy crop and can tolerate some frost, but prolonged exposure to cold temperatures can damage the roots. Consider using row covers to protect your beet bed from late frosts.",
    "Moncton's soil tends to be acidic, so make sure to add lime to your garden beds if necessary to maintain a pH between 6.0-7.0 for optimal plant growth.",
    "Water your plants regularly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot and other problems. Beets and peppers prefer well-draining soil."
