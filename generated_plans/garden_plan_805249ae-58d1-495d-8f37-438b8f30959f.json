    "Cucumbers prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Test your soil before planting to ensure it meets these conditions.",
    "In Moncton's short growing season, use row covers or other frost protection methods to extend the cucumber harvest period.",
    "Water cucumbers consistently, but avoid overwatering which can lead to fungal diseases. Aim for about 1 inch of water per week.",
    "Cucumbers are a warm-season crop and prefer full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight). Choose a location that receives plenty of sunlight."
