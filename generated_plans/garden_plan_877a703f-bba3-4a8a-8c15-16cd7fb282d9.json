    "For Green Beans, plant bush beans instead of pole beans since they require less support and can thrive in Moncton's shorter growing season.",
    "Select a variety of Tomato that is resistant to late blight such as 'Early Girl' or 'Patio', which can mature quickly enough to avoid the risk of disease in Moncton's cool summers.",
    "Make sure to harden off seedlings before transplanting them outdoors by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions over the course of 7-10 days.",
    "Use raised beds and a good quality potting mix to improve drainage and soil structure, which can help mitigate the effects of Moncton's cold and wet climate.",
    "Keep an eye out for common pests such as aphids, slugs, and snails, and take action promptly if you notice any damage to your plants."
