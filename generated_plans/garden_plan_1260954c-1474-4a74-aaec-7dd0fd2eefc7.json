    "Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil for your garden, as both cabbage and eggplant require full sun to produce well.",
    "In Moncton's cool climate, start seedlings indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date (around May 15th) to give them a head start on the growing season.",
    "Kale is a hardy crop that can tolerate light frosts, but cabbage and eggplant are more sensitive. Use row covers or bring potted plants under cover if there's a risk of frost.",
    "Soil temperature affects germination rates - wait until soil has warmed up to at least 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F) before planting cool-season crops like kale and cabbage.",
    "Eggplant is a warm-season crop that thrives in temperatures above 18\u00b0C (65\u00b0F). Plant it after the last frost date, when the soil has warmed up.",
    "Keep your garden consistently watered, but avoid overwatering which can lead to root rot and other issues. Aim for about 2-3 inches of rainfall or irrigation per week.",
    "Monitor for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails that can damage your crops. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible to maintain a healthy garden ecosystem."
