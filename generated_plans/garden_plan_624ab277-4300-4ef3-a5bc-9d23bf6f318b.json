    "In Moncton's short growing season, plant garlic as soon as the soil can be worked in spring, about 4-6 weeks before the last frost date.",
    "Tomatoes need full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) and support as they grow. Consider using a trellis or cage to keep them upright.",
    "In New Brunswick's cool climate, it's essential to provide protection for your plants from extreme weather conditions such as frost, wind, and hail.",
    "Soil preparation is key in Moncton's cold climate. Add organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil structure and fertility."
