    "In Moncton's cool climate, start spinach seeds indoors 2-3 weeks before the last frost date to give them a head start on the growing season.",
    "Radishes are quick-growing and can be directly sown into the garden in late spring. Make sure the soil is loose and well-draining for optimal growth.",
    "Tomato plants need support as they grow, so install tomato cages or trellises before planting to keep them upright and promote even fruiting.",
    "Spinach prefers cooler temperatures, but can bolt (go to seed) if it gets too hot. Monitor the temperature and provide shade for your spinach plants during heatwaves.",
    "In Moncton's short growing season, focus on early-producing radish varieties that mature in as little as 20-25 days to ensure a continuous harvest."
