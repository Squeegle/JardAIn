    "Basil is a warm-season crop that thrives in the long growing season of Beverly Hills. Plant it in well-draining soil with full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) and keep the temperature between 60-80\u00b0F.",
    "Tomatoes love the warm weather in Beverly Hills, but they need support to grow upright. Use tomato cages or trellises to keep them off the ground and promote healthy growth.",
    "In the hot summer months, water your plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth. This will help them survive during periods of drought.",
    "Basil is a heavy feeder and needs regular fertilization. Use a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) once a month to keep it healthy and pest-free.",
    "Tomatoes are prone to pests like hornworms and aphids in the Beverly Hills area. Keep an eye out for these pests and use organic pesticides if necessary.",
    "In the cooler winter months, protect your plants from frost by covering them with a sheet or bringing potted plants indoors."
