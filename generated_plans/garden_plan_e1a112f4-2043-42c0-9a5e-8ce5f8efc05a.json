    "Choose varieties of broccoli that mature quickly (around 50-60 days) to ensure you get a harvest before the first frost.",
    "Peppers are warm-season crops and prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Make sure your garden bed has good drainage and add organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil structure.",
    "Spinach is a cool-season crop that prefers partial shade and consistent moisture. Plant it in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked, or in late summer for a fall harvest.",
    "In Moncton's cold climate, it's essential to provide protection from frost using row covers or other methods when planting broccoli and spinach.",
    "Broccoli and peppers require full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) to produce well. Make sure your garden bed receives sufficient sunlight and consider using a trellis for support if needed."
