    "In Moncton's cold climate, start seedlings indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date (around May 15th) to give them a head start on the growing season.",
    "Carrots are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, so make sure your soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged. Aim for a temperature range of 60-70\u00b0F (15-21\u00b0C).",
    "Lettuce prefers cooler temperatures and can bolt (go to seed) in warmer weather. Plant it in early spring or late summer/early fall when the temperatures are cooler.",
    "Moncton's growing season is relatively short, so make sure to plant cool-season crops like carrots and lettuce as soon as possible after the last frost date.",
    "Use a raised bed or container garden if your soil is heavy clay or sandy. This will help improve drainage and aeration for your plants."
