    "Start seedlings indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date to give them a head start on the growing season.",
    "Choose varieties of Tomato and Broccoli that are specifically bred for cooler climates and shorter growing seasons, such as 'Early Girl' or 'Deep Purple' Tomatoes and 'Waltham 29' or 'Packman' Broccolis.",
    "Prepare your soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve its structure and fertility. Moncton's cold climate can lead to compacted soil, so make sure to loosen it up before planting.",
    "Tomatoes need full sun (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) to produce well, so choose a location that gets plenty of sunlight. Broccoli prefers partial shade, especially in warmer weather, so consider providing some afternoon shade for your broccoli plants.",
    "Water your plants regularly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to disease and root rot. Tomatoes need about 1-2 inches of water per week, while broccoli needs about 1 inch of water per week.",
    "Watch out for common pests in Moncton's climate, such as aphids, whiteflies, and slugs, and take action promptly if you notice any infestations."
