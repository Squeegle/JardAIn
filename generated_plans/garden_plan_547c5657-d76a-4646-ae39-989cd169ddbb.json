    "Start your garden as soon as the soil can be worked in spring, typically around late May or early June in Moncton.",
    "Choose pepper varieties that mature quickly (around 60-70 days) to ensure a harvest before the first frost.",
    "Beets prefer well-draining, loose soil and full sun. Make sure your garden bed has good drainage and is at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.",
    "In Moncton's cool climate, peppers may require additional support as they grow. Use tomato cages or trellises to keep them upright and promote even fruiting.",
    "Beets are a cool-season crop and can tolerate light frosts. However, be sure to harvest them before the first hard frost (usually around late September in Moncton).",
    "To extend the growing season for peppers, consider using row covers or cold frames to protect plants from early frosts."
