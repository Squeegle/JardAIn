    "Pineapple plants prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5, so test your soil before planting.",
    "In Moncton's cold climate, it's best to grow pineapple as an indoor plant or in a greenhouse until the temperature warms up in late spring.",
    "Choose a variety of pineapple that is resistant to frost, such as 'Smooth Cayenne' or 'Red Spanish', for better success in your garden.",
    "Pineapple plants require full sun to produce fruit, so choose a location with direct sunlight for at least 6 hours a day.",
    "Water your pineapple plant regularly, but make sure the soil isn't waterlogged. Pineapples are sensitive to root rot and can be susceptible to fungal diseases in wet conditions.",
    "Fertilize your pineapple plant with a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) during the growing season (April to September), following the manufacturer's instructions for application rates."
