    "Purple kale is a cold-hardy crop that can thrive in Moncton's climate. Sow its seeds directly into the garden in late spring, around June 1st, when the soil has warmed up to at least 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F).",
    "To protect your plants from frost, wait until the last frost date (May 15th) before transplanting seedlings outdoors and provide them with a cold frame or row covers if necessary.",
    "Tomatoes need support as they grow. Use tomato cages or trellises to keep them upright and promote even fruiting.",
    "Keep your garden consistently watered, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to disease and root rot in both tomatoes and kale."
