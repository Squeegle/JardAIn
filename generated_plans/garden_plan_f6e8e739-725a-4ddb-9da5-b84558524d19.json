    "Peppers prefer well-drained soil and full sun, so make sure to plant them in a location with good air circulation.",
    "Cucumbers are sensitive to frost, so wait until the soil has warmed up to at least 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F) before planting them directly into the garden.",
    "In Moncton's cold climate, it's essential to provide support for pepper plants as they grow to prevent wind damage and promote healthy growth.",
    "Lettuce prefers cooler temperatures, so avoid planting it in areas with full sun during the hottest part of the day. Instead, choose a location that receives partial shade, especially during summer months.",
    "Consider using row covers or cold frames to extend the growing season for lettuce and other cool-season crops like cucumbers."
