    "Choose varieties of lettuce that are resistant to bolting (going to seed) such as 'Rouge d'Hiver' or 'Lolla Rosa', which can tolerate cooler temperatures and longer days.",
    "Peppers prefer well-draining soil and full sun, so choose a location with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.",
    "In Moncton's cool climate, peppers may need protection from frost until the last frost date. Use row covers or bring potted plants under cover to prevent damage.",
    "Lettuce prefers cooler temperatures and can bolt if exposed to high heat. Plant it in a location with partial shade, especially during warmer months.",
    "Moncton's growing season is relatively short, so make the most of it by planting cool-season crops like lettuce early in the spring or late in the summer for a fall harvest."
