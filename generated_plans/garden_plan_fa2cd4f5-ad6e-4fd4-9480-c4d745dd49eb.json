    "Start your seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date (around May 15th) to give them a head start on the growing season.",
    "Choose a location with full sun to partial shade for your garden, as both kale and lettuce require at least 4 hours of direct sunlight per day.",
    "Prepare your soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and drainage. Kale and lettuce prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil pH (around 6.0-7.0).",
    "Water your plants regularly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot and other problems. Aim for about 1 inch of water per week.",
    "Watch out for pests like aphids, slugs, and snails, which can be a problem in Moncton's cool climate. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible.",
    "Harvest your kale and lettuce leaves regularly to encourage the plants to produce new growth and prevent them from flowering.",
    "Consider using row covers or cold frames to extend the growing season and protect your plants from frost damage."
